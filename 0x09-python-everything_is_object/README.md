## General
***
* Why Python programming is awesome
* What is an object
* What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
* What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
* What is a reference
* What is an assignment
* What is an alias
* How to know if two variables are identical
* How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
* How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
* What is mutable and immutable
* What are the built-in mutable types
* What are the built-in immutable types
* How does Python pass variables to functions

## Requirements
***

### Python Scripts

* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc

### .txt Answer Files

* Only one line
* No Shebang
* All your files should end with a new line
